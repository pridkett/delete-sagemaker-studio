Overview
--------

This is a *really* simple script that deletes all running instances of
SageMaker Studio from your account. There are probably lots of ways that this
script can be configured in the future, but for my narrow set of tasks this
works well enough right now.

Usage
-----

```bash
./delete-sagemaker-studio.sh
```
